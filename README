How To Build
-------------------------------------------------
Open up terminal and change directory to the location
of 'craps.cpp'. Enter the command 'make craps' to
compile and build the executable. Proceed to run
the executable, or type './craps' in terminal.
*************************************************
How to play
-------------------------------------------------
You start with a pot of $50. Enter your bid,
within your pay-able range (0 to your pot) and
hit ENTER. The 2 dice will be rolled. Your roll
follows:
2,3,12: You lose the roll.
7,11: You win the roll.
Otherwise your roll becomes your "point", and
you continue to roll until you get your "point"
or a 7. If you make your point, you win. If you
roll a 7, you lose.

If you win, you get your bid added to your total pot,
if you lose your bid is removed from your pot.

You will be then asked if you wish to play again.
Type 'y' to play again, and proceed to enter a new
bid again. Otherwise, press 'n' to cash out with your
winnings.
**************************************************
How to remove
--------------------------------------------------
In terminal go to the directory that 'craps' is
located. Type 'make clean' to remove all but
source files.
